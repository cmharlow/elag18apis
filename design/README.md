## Installing go-swagger tool

This presumes you already have go installed on your machine and are running the commands in this repository within your go working directory.

We use `go-swagger` to generate the API code within the `generated/` directory.

We connect the specification-generated API code to our own handlers defined with `handlers/`. Handlers are where we add our own logic for processing requests.

Our handlers and the generated API code is connected within `main.go`, which is the file to start the API.

### Install Go-Swagger

The API code is generated from `swagger.json` using `go-swagger` library. As this is not used in the existing codebase anywhere currently, you'll need to install the `go-swagger` library before running these commands (commands for those using Mac OSX):

```shell
$ brew tap go-swagger/go-swagger
$ brew install go-swagger
$ brew upgrade go-swagger
```

This should give you the `swagger` binary command in your $GOPATH and allow you to manage versions better. The version of your go-swagger binary is **0.13.0** (run `swagger version` to check this).

### Nota Bene on go-swagger install from source

If instead of brew, you decide to install go-swagger from source (i.e. `go get -u github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger`), you will be running the library at its Github `dev` branch. You will need to change into that library (`cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger`) and checkout from Github the latest release (`git checkout tags/0.13.0`). Then you will need to run `go install github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger` to generate the go-swagger binary in your `$GOPATH/bin`.
